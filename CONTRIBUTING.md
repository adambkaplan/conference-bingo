# Contributor Guide

Want to add a conference word list, or improve the code?
I welcome contributions from anyone!

All contributors agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) for this repository.

## Adding a Word List

If you wish to add a word list for a conference, please open a GitHub issue first.
Conferences that are open to the public and publish a code of conduct will generally be accepted.
When submitting your request, please provide links that will help reviewers understand what the event is about.

After the issue is opened and accepted, you may submit a pull request to add your word list.
The terms should be listed in alphabetical order.
If you are adding a new top-level conference, please include a `README.md` describing the conference and any links to the event.

## Updating a Word List

To update a word list for an existing conference, please submit a pull request that modifies an existing list.
If possible, please add a link to an existing GitHub issue for the conference (if one exists) in your pull request description.

Please ensure that the word list remains in alphabetical order.

## Improvements

Got an idea to improve the code? Found a bug to fix?
Go ahead and submit a pull request to improve the code!

Code changes should include unit tests to verify the updated behavior and adhere to [PEP 8 style conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Submit a Pull Request

1. Before you begin, make sure you [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository) to hold your changes.
3. [Push](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository) your code change or word list update to your branch.
4. Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) from your fork's branch to this repository.

The maintainer (me!) will review your pull request at their convenience.
This project is for fun - I make no guarantees as to when I'll be able to review your submission!

If multiple people are collaborating on a file (like a word list), please be sure to [rebase your branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/using-git-rebase-on-the-command-line) if a conflict is detected.
