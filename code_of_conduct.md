# Code of Conduct

This is a hobby project of mine, therefore I am trying to keep things simple:

1. Be nice
2. Don't be a jerk
3. Keep the word list language clean

If you stick to the guidelines of the [Contributor Covenant 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), you will not have a problem contributing to this project.

## Enforcement

Behavior that violates the spirit of the code of conduct will be subject to any of the following actions at my sole discretion:

1. Temporary blocks/delays in submission approvals.
2. Blocks to submitting code or commenting on issues.
3. Reporting to GitHub if the behavior is severe enough to violate their Terms of Service.

## Word List Codes of Conduct

Collaborative word lists that are associated with a conference may be subject to their respective codes of conduct.
Observed violations may be reported to conference organizers independent of any action on my part.
